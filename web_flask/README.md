## Tasks

-  Write a script that starts a Flask web application:
   - Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
   - Routes:
     - /: display “Hello HBNB!”
   - You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

      - H1 tag: “Number: n is even|odd” inside the tag BODY
  - You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

- Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine: 
  - Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)
    - Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
  - Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)
    - Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
  - Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present
    - If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State

- Write a script that starts a Flask web application:
  - Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
  - You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
  - After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
    - Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
    - Call in this method storage.close()
  - Routes:
    - /states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
      - H1 tag: “States”
      - UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
      	- LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
  - Import this 7-dump to have some data
  - You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

## IMPORTANT

- Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
- Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py

  - You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
  - To load all cities of a State:
    - If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
    - Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
  - After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
    - Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext

  - Routes:
    - /cities_by_states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
      - H1 tag: “States”
      - UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
      - LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B> + UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
      	- LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>

    - /states/<id>: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
      - If a State object is found with this id:
      	- H1 tag: “State: ”
	- H3 tag: “Cities:”
	- UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
	  - LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>

      - H1 tag: “Not found!”

      - Copy files icon.png and logo.png from web_static/images/ to the folder web_flask/static/images
      - Update .popover class in 6-filters.css to allow scrolling in the popover and a max height of 300 pixels.
      - Use 6-index.html content as source code for the template 10-hbnb_filters.html:
      	- Replace the content of the H4 tag under each filter title (H3 States and H3 Amenities) by &nbsp;
      - State, City and Amenity objects must be loaded from DBStorage and sorted by name (A->Z)
